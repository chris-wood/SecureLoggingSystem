\begin{abstract}

User-based non-repudiation is a system security property that provides indisputable evidence that links
specific actions to individual users (or entities) that trigger such actions. Cryptographically speaking, non-repudiation requires that the integrity and 
origin of all data should be provable. In essence, this enables system audits to be conducted that can
identify data misuse (and thus, potential security policy violations) by comparing the sources of system events
with all entities authorized to invoke these events. Therefore, treating non-repudiation as a required system 
quality attribute in the SaaS architecture is likely to become a common trend in the commercial, 
government, and even more specifically, the health-care domain.

System audits typically use system log files to determine the cause and effect of events that took 
place during the system's lifetime. In order to provide accurate information for non-repudiation purposes,
it is often necessary to place some amount user-sensitive data in these log files that can be used
to trace data back to its origin. As such, log data generated by a client that is being served must
maintain data confidentiality and integrity should the system be compromised. These goals are commonly achieved
using a combination of encryption and signature techniques. However, traditional approaches to
encryption and signature generation and verification are no longer applicable in the context of cloud
systems. Furthermore, naive approaches to log security that are based on tamper-resistant hardware and 
maintaining continuous secure communication channels between a log aggregator and end user are no longer useful in 
the context of cloud-based applications. 

Symmetric-key and public-key encryption of log entries have been the most common confidentiality techniques 
proposed in the literature. However, in cloud systems, these schemes are becoming out-dated technologies.
There is a need for robust access policy control so that user revocation and addition can be done on the fly
with minimal overhead (i.e. re-encrypting a subset of the log database should be avoided). Both symmetric- and 
public-key cryptosystems lack in that access policies must be tied directly to keys used for
encryption and decryption. If the access policy for a set of log messages needs to be changed, then both the keys used to
encrypt and decrypt such log entries will need to be regenerated and distributed, and the entries must also
be re-encrypted. Both of these can be very expensive tasks. 

In addition, symmetric-key cryptosystems require keys to be shared among users who need access to the 
same set of logs, which requires a secure and comprehensive key management and distribution policy to be 
in place. Enforcement of access policies to certain log entries may require re-keying and encryption of 
an entire set of log files in the database if a user's access is revoked. From a storage 
perspective, public-key cryptosystems (e.g. RSA) suffer from the extra data transfer and 
storage requirements for large cryptographic keys. It may be too expensive to maintain a public-key
infrastructure (PKI) for managing keys and digital certificates for all users. 

In terms of log file integrity, aggregate signature schemes that support forward secrecy through the use of 
symmetric- and public-key cryptosystems are also becoming outdated. Symmetric-key schemes may promote
high computational efficiency for signature generation, but they do not directly support public verifiability for 
administrators and auditors. This means that robust key distribution schemes or the introduction of a trusted third party (TTP) are needed to ensure all required parties can access the necessary log information. Such schemes also 
suffer from high storage requirements and communication overhead. Public-key schemes have similar issues, 
as the increased key size leads to even larger storage requirements and less computational efficiency. 

From this we see that a balance between encryption and signature generation and verification performance is
needed to support the unique scalability and resource usage requirements for cloud applications.
Attribute-based encryption (ABE), a new cryptographic scheme that uses user attributes (or roles, in certain 
circumstances) to maintain the confidentiality of user-sensitive data, has an appealing application
to logging systems in the cloud for a variety of reasons. 

In this project we will continue the work on ABLS, an attribute-based logging system that 
supports ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) \cite{Bethencourt2007-CPABE} 
and authenticated hash-chain constructions for log file confidentiality and integrity. The preliminary
design of ABLS was weak with regards to the scalability of encryption operations under heavy traffic loads,
the relational schema to store log-data, and the interactions with database servers. To address these issues, we
will modify ABLS in the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The CP-ABE encryption scheme will be replaced with a hybrid cryptosystem in which the Advanced
	Encryption Standard (AES), the standardized symmetric-key encryption algorithm, is used to encrypt user
	session data by a key that is protected with CP-ABE encryption. In the event that a user generates log messages
	with varying sensitivity levels during a single session, multiple symmetric keys will be produced to maintain
	the confidentiality of information in different security classes.
	\item The relational database storage scheme will either be changed to include a masking column in the appropriate
	log table to hide user identities or replaced entirely with a document- or object-based database. Both of these
	modern database systems are similar in semantics (if documents are conceptually treated as serialized objects),
	so a product and literature survey will be conducted prior to selecting an adequate replacement that satisfies
	the necessary security and performance requirements. Though, based on preferences and architectural experience,
	a document-based database such as MongoDB will be the likely candidate. Also, since the ABLS architecture is highly
	structured around a relational schema to store data, this change will require modifications made in the logging, attribute authority, 
	and auditing modules in order to maintain functional correctness. 
	\item Database security mechanisms, including client authentication to support granular access policies for protected databases, 
	will be implemented. This is particularly
	important for the databases that store cryptographic keys. Since preference is given to document-based databases such as MongoDB,
	third-party services such as zNcrypt (provided by Gazzang) that are specifically tailored to this DBMS will be used to enforce 
	access control to sensitive databases.
	\item The auditing module will be extended to include audits of the database operation and the data contained therein. Currently,
	the auditing module is only designed (and partially implemented) to support strategy-based audits on database contents. However,
	in this type of application, database performance and security are almost as critical. Thus, with this change, there will be two audit 
	techniques with that can roughly be equated to data and policy audits, both of which will only be accessible to clients with the
	appropriate privileges. This access control will be likely be enforced using username and password credentials.
\end{enumerate}

With these changes, we will re-evaluate the ABLS system at an architectural, security, and performance
perspective to determine its usefulness in cloud-based settings. 

TODO: security features to be explored in the analysis!
