- Creating the certificate:

openssl genrsa 1024 > key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key key > cert

TODO:
1. add eventID to the payload of incoming messages so that the appropriate policy can be built

- Database setup (TODO list)
 -> draw the EHR diagram for the database
 -> need to set up verifier key encryption (the epoch and entity keys, encrypted by salted master key with the session), key is hash(master + user + session)
 -> set up symmetric key encryption for payloads
 -> start moving some of the related work from the report to the final paper
 -> encrypt user and session IDs using keys that are stored in local SQLite database and protected by the OS (encryption key for these are hash (master + user + session)
 ->
